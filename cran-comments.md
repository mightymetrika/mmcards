## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed the \dontrun{} wrap from the i_deck() example.

* I also added comments to the i_deck() example to make it more useful by:
    *Explaining that the example is adding image paths for a standard 52-card
    deck based when the images referenced in the ?vector_playing_cards
    documentation are stored in the working directory.
    *Refering the user to the README example which shows how to incorporate the
    deck of cards with images into a 'shiny' application

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
